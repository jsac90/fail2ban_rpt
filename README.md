# fail2ban_rpt
I made a custom report that sends me a daily email (in combination with a cron job) about how many people tripped fail2ban in the previous 24 hours. Kind of interesting to see. I know there are probably better solutions to do this but this was my attempt at something completely custom and taught me a lot about bash scripting and linux in general.
